# Carplet
This is a fully configurable card game built by `pygame` that 
allows you to customize game plots as you wish. It builds
a fun card-based strategy game out-of-box and is really 
easy to get started.

We have provided a few sample game plots in `plot.json` 
for you to get familiar with how Carplet works. In this
plot, you become the mayor of a city. You will be 
constantly facing various crises, ranging from 
environmental disasters to social unrest. You need to 
make decisions accordingly. Every decision you make affects 
different stakeholders differently. You are expected to make 
decisions with careful consideration in mind since if one 
party gets really annoyed, your journey as a mayor would 
come to an end.

## Get Started
### Sample Game: I'm the Mayor
To get started with our sample game plots is simple. Running
the provided `main.py` in the correct directory will suffice.

```shell
$ pwd
/your/path/to/carplet

$ python3 main.py
pygame 2.1.2 (SDL 2.0.18, Python 3.8.9)
Hello from the pygame community...
